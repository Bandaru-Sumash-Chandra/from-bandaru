## Kabaddi
My favorite game is kabaddi because it combines power, agility, and strategy to provide both **physical and cerebral challenges**. I find it enjoyable to **collaborate with others** and make decisions quickly, as it keeps me focused throughout the game. Every minute is exhilarating because of the pleasure of raiding and defending; it gives me a **sense of accomplishment** and enjoyment.
